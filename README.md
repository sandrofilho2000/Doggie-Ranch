> This README guides through the process of creating new features and fixing bugs in the Doggie Ranch project.

My version of Doggie Ranch includes pages for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting project Models.

## Services

> This model includes the fields: name and cost.

### Service List

![Service List](https://github.com/sandrofilho2000/Doggie-Ranch/assets/75636911/80aad888-26cf-4dae-bad7-c2bf09b2c1f0)

> It lists every added service with a delete button included.

### Service Adding

![Service Adding](https://github.com/sandrofilho2000/Doggie-Ranch/assets/75636911/70d5306b-e5d2-4121-9a9a-6e25cfb192db)

> This form makes it possible to add any service with any cost.

### Service Editing

> Works similarly to the add form. Once the item is updated, it will update every related appointment.

## Pets

> This model includes the fields: first name, last name, species, and profile image (optional).

![Pets](https://github.com/sandrofilho2000/Doggie-Ranch/assets/75636911/f04829c0-33a3-4586-a2c0-7f845cb1ae19)

> Even though the profile image is not a required field of the form, we can notice that the newly created item receives the image from the species model.

> Works the same as the adding model, but the input receives values of the model as default.

## Customers

> This model includes the fields: first name, last name, email, and profile image (optional).

![Customers](https://github.com/sandrofilho2000/Doggie-Ranch/assets/75636911/00dfa9f5-1a81-4f6e-85c3-bad096d17781)
